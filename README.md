# CV for Johan Nordberg

I solve problems using technology. 

My entire life, I have been deeply engaged in the world of programming. The ability to identify a problem and envision a more efficient solution through software has always captivated me. When I was about 10 years old, my older sisters boyfriend showed my Basic and then I knew what I wanted to work with the rest of my life. 

I began my professional career in 1997 at a prominent web development agency in Sweden, where I immersed myself in web and app development. Since then, I have gained extensive experience working in diverse environments, including larger agencies, small companies, co-owned ventures, and as a self-employed professional. In recent years, I have had the privilege of serving as a Cloud Solution Architect with a focus on App Innovation and Sustainability at Microsoft. Despite my professional commitments, I continue to maintain and contribute to projects and applications through my own company.

## Technology skills 

Throughout my career, I have seamlessly transitioned between frontend, backend, database, and app development. Whether working in smaller teams or managing my own projects, I have prioritized gaining a deep understanding of the full stack. This versatility allows me to move effortlessly between different technologies and deliver from zero to production. 

### Dotnet
I have consistently relied on the **.net** eco system. I began with Classic ASP, VB, and COM+, and when the .net framework was introduced, I seamlessly transitioned to it. With the advent of **.net Core**, I embraced it for new projects, leveraging its modern capabilities, improved performance and most of all it cross platform capabilities.

During the years I've build both full web sites and high performant API:s with .net serving many users while using cheap hardware.

### React & Next js
After working on the frontend with various frameworks and patterns like Jquery, Angular, Knockout, etc, I tried **ReactJS** and got hooked. Since around 2014 all my frontend development has been in **React** or **NextJS**. The combination of React & TypeScript felt so natural to me and took away many of the biggest pains with frontend development. 

### Node
When I started using React and Next JS it also felt natural to use TypeScript and Node for API's and backend programming. Depending on the usecase I choose asp.net core or **node** js. Both has it's own pros and cons and I feel very comfortable with both. I have mainly used **ExpressJS**. 

One of the biggest projects I still maintain uses Express JS for backend API:s and Next JS for the web frontend. 

### Native apps
Around the time the iPad was released I started building educational apps for schools. At that time, doing it natively was the only option, which meant learning **Objective C** for iOS and **Java** for Android. Over the years I switched to **Swift** and **Kotlin**. I still maintain a couple of these apps with both Objective C and Swift.

### React Native
For new app projects I mainly use **React Native**. Having the same stack for both web and app helps with productivity and avoiding context switching. As a solo developer, React Native has played a huge part in making me productive enough to publish apps both on iOS, Android and Web. 

### Relational Database
**Microsoft SQL Server** was the first database I started with in 1997. I still use that for many projects. Over the years I've started using **PostgreSQL** more and more. During the years I've also worked with NoSQL databases like **RavenDB** and I have **Azure Cosmos DB** certification.
