# CV for Johan Nordberg

I solve problems using technology. 

I have been programming more or less all my life. I really like seeing a problem and thinking "hmm, this should be easier" and trying to fix it with software. 

In 1997 I started working at one of the web development agencies in Sweden. Since then, I've been doing web and app development basically every day.

## Skills

### Dotnet
.net has been a constant in my development career. Started out with Classic ASP, VB and COM+ and when .net framework was announce I switched to that. When dotnet core came along I switched to that for new projects. 

### React & Next js
After doing frontend with various frameworks and patterns like Jquery, Angular, Knockout, etc, I tried ReactJS and got hooked. Since around 2014 all my frontend development has been in React or NextJS. The combination of React & TypeScript felt so natural and took away many of the biggest pains with frontend development. 

### Node
When I started using React and Next JS it also felt natural to use TypeScript and Node for API's and backend programming. Depending on the usecase I choose asp.net core or node js. Both has it's own pros and cons and I feel very comfortable with both. I have mainly used ExpressJS. 

### Native apps
Around the time the iPad was released I started building educational apps for schools. At that time, doing it natively was the only option, which meant Objective C for iOS and Java for Android. Over the years that became Swift and Kotlin instead. I still maintain a couple of these apps with both Objective C and Swift.

### React Native
For new app projects I mainly use React Native. Having the same stack for both web and app helps with productivity and avoiding context switching. 

### Relational Database
**Microsoft SQL Server** was the first database I started with in 1997. I still use that for many projects. Over the years I've started using **PostgreSQL** more and more.
